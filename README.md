# Library-Management-System

### A library management system is used to maintain library records. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library, how many books are issued, or how many books have been returned .

### And I have created different entities like Books,Author,Student,LibraryCard and made some API's for those entities .

### Technologies used : Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA, Hibernate, Swagger, Tomcat server .
